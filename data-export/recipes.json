Knead to form a smooth dough.\",\"Allow the dough to rise in a covered bowl until it's light and airy, with visible gas bubbles. The dough will expand and become puffy. Depending on the vigor of your starter, this may take up to 5 hours (or even longer). For best results, gently deflate the dough once an hour by turning it out onto a lightly floured work surface, stretching and folding the edges into the center, and turning it over before returning it to the bowl. Adding these folds will give you a better sense of how the dough is progressing, as well as strengthen it.\",\"Gently divide the dough in half.\",\"Gently shape the dough into two rounds or oval loaves, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until very puffy, about 2 to 4 hours (or longer; give them sufficient time to become noticeably puffy). Don't worry if the loaves spread more than they rise; they'll pick up once they hit the oven's heat. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F.\",\"Spray the loaves with lukewarm water.\",\"Slash the loaves. If you've made round loaves, try one slash across the center, and a curved slash on each side of it; or slash in the pattern of your choice. For oval loaves, two diagonal slashes are fine. Make the slashes fairly deep; a serrated bread knife, wielded firmly, works well here.\",\"Bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's a very deep golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack.\",\"Store bread, loosely wrapped in plastic, for several days at room temperature; freeze for longer storage.\"]",

Note: The dough starts off very slack and wet. That’s OK; it will transform itself through time and folds.\",\"Oil a two-quart rectangular baking dish (10” x 7”) with the olive oil. If you don’t have a 2-quart dish, an 8” or 9” square pan will work. Don’t worry about any pan you use being oven-safe; you won’t be baking the bread in it.\",\"Pour the dough into the pan.

If it's less than 72°F, move the pan to a warmer spot, e.g., your oven with the light turned on.\",\"Cover the pan and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.\",\"Start with a bowl fold: Use your wet hands to grab a section of dough from one side, lift it up, then press it down into the middle. Repeat this eight to 12 times.\",\"Cover the dish and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.\",\"Then do a coil fold: With wet hands, reach under the dough and stretch the middle upward until the dough releases from the dish. Roll it forward off your hands, allowing it to fold over (or “coil”) on itself. This is called a coil fold. Rotate the dish 90 degrees (a quarter turn) and repeat. Continue performing this folding action until the dough feels like it won’t stretch and elongate easily, usually four to five times initially. Note: You’ll be doing this three more times, each time building strength and developing the dough. See \\\"tips,\\\" below, for more details,\",\"Cover the pan and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.\",\"Repeat the coil fold. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.\",\"At this point, the dough should be easier to handle and feel tighter. Repeat the coil fold using only two or three folds this time. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.\",\"Repeat the coil fold one last time, using only one or two folds if the dough is relatively strong. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for about 80 minutes.\",\"To divide the dough: As gently as possible, turn the dough out onto a heavily floured surface, maintaining the rectangle or square shape – be careful not to deflate the delicate dough. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on top of the dough, leaving no exposed sticky spots. Then, working as gently as possible, use a bench knife or other sharp knife to divide it into four pieces. Gently place two pieces on a piece of parchment, leaving space between them. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of dough, placing them on another piece of parchment.\",\"Allow the loaves to rest at room temperature for 2 hours, uncovered. While the loaves are resting, preheat the oven to 475°F with a baking stone or steel on a lower rack. (If you don't have a stone or steel, see \\\"tips,\\\" below.) Allow the oven to preheat for 1 hour to ensure it’s thoroughly heated. The loaves are ready for the oven when there are a few large bubbles on the surface of each loaf and they feel light and airy.\",\"To bake the bread: Carefully slide the two loaves (still resting on the parchment) into the oven onto the preheated stone or steel. If space is tight and the full sheet of parchment won’t fit on the stone or steel, cut the parchment between the two loaves and arrange them as best you can. Allow the other two loaves to continue to rest.\",\"Bake the loaves for 15 minutes, then transfer them, from the stone or steel, directly onto a rack in the upper third of the oven for an additional 13 to 15 minutes. (Leave the stone in place.) Moving them to the rack allows the baking stone or steel to become hot again in preparation for the next two loaves. After a total of 27 to 30 minutes of baking, remove the loaves from the oven and allow them to cool on a rack.\",\"Repeat the process with the two remaining loaves. Cool the bread fully before slicing.\",\"Storage information: Wrap the bread loosely and store it at room temperature for up to several days; freeze for longer storage.\"]",

Slice or dollop the cold butter in and work gently with a fork or pastry cutter to cut it in. Don’t overwork, just get it incorporated.\",\"Next add ice cold water a little at a time and use a wooden spoon to stir. Only add as much water as you need to help it come together (don't add more than 6 tablespoons).\",\"Once a crumbly dough is formed, transfer to a piece of plastic wrap (or parchment paper) and work gently with your hands to form a 1/2 inch thick disc. Wrap firmly and refrigerate for a minimum 30 minutes, up to 2 days. Just let it warm back up a little before using. You don’t want it too warm or it can get too soft to handle.\",\"Once your dough is chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and prepare pie filling.\",\"Add all pie filling ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.\",\"To roll out the crust, unwrap the disc and place it between two sizable layers of parchment or wax paper (plastic wrap will work OK, but is a little more difficult to work with). Use a rolling pin to gently roll it into the shape of your pie pan (we recommend a standard 9-inch pan). If it cracks, don’t stress – you can reform it with your hands once you get it in the pan. But try and be gentle.\",\"To transfer the crust, remove the top layer of wax paper and gently lay the pie dish face down on top of the crust and use the support of the wax paper to quickly but carefully invert it. Don’t overthink it – just do it.\",\"Once you get the crust inverted, gently use your hands to form it into the pan, working the crust up along the sides. It can be a little tricky but it bakes beautifully, so it’s worth the effort! Just try not to overwork the dough in the process – it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to perfect the shape. Any holes or cracks can be mended with a little excess dough and the heat of your hand.\",\"TIP: I would advise against trying to be fancy and do any elaborate design with the crust, so just get the crust in, get a flat edge and go.\",\"Pour filling into pie crust and bake for 58-65 minutes. The crust should be light golden brown and the filling will still be just a bit jiggly and have some cracks on the top. Remove from oven and let cool completely before loosely covering and transferring to the refrigerator to fully set for 4-6 hours, preferably overnight.\",\"Slice and serve with coconut whipped cream and an additional sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or pumpkin pie spice (optional).

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt and whisk to combine. Working quickly, add in the cold vegan butter and use clean hands to begin pressing the butter into the flour. Avoid crumbling up the butter and instead try to press each piece into a flat “flake” — this will help create the best flaky crust! Continue until there are no large chunks of butter remaining.\",\"Add the maple syrup and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of the ice cold water. Use a fork to gently toss the mixture together, doing your best to evenly distribute the liquid without breaking the butter down any further. Continue adding water until the mixture looks evenly moist and soft and sticks together easily when pressed between your fingers. It might look a little crumbly, but resist the temptation to add more water!\",\"On a clean work surface, lay out a piece of parchment or wax paper and transfer the dough. Gather it together and press it into a “disc” about 1 inch tall by 6 inches wide. Wrap the paper around it and transfer to the refrigerator for 15 minutes. If you want to make your crust ahead of time, stop at this point and you can refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 1 month, just make sure to thaw the crust (until slightly soft when poked) before rolling out.\",\"Carefully remove the crust from the refrigerator and work quickly to prevent the butter from melting. Unwrap the dough, leaving the paper underneath as a work surface. Sprinkle the top of the crust with a very light dusting of flour, then place another piece of parchment or wax paper on top of the crust and begin rolling it out until it’s ~11 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick. It can be helpful to start by “whacking” the dough to spread it out, then switching to rolling. If the crust is cracking a lot, give it a couple minutes to warm up slightly.\",\"To transfer your crust, gently roll it up onto your rolling pin and unroll in the pie pan, or quickly (and confidently!) flip it into the pan. We chose to flip it. Press the crust into the pie pan so the bottom edges are smooth and patch any cracks with excess dough. Crimp the edges together with your fingers or press with a fork.\",\"If making a pie with a filling that requires baking (i.e. pumpkin pie, pecan pie, apple pie, berry pie), par-bake the crust for 20 minutes, until pale and dry to the touch. Then add your filling of choice and bake for another 30-45 minutes, or according to the recipe’s instructions. If making a pie with a raw/chilled filling (i.e. chocolate cream pie) you will want to par-bake the crust on its own for at least 30-35 minutes total, until the edges are golden and beginning to crisp, before adding your filling and chilling.\"]",

    "directions": "[\"Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, warm milk, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.\",\"Add the butter, salt, and 1 cup flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add another cup of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still be chunks of butter). Add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. *If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle!*\",\"Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5–8 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5–8 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need; you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\",\"1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)\",\"Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan.\",\"Shape the bread: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches. It does not have to be perfect—in fact, it will probably be rounded on the edges. That’s ok! Roll it up into an 8 inch log and place in the prepared loaf pan.\",\"2nd Rise: Cover shaped loaf with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until it’s about 1 inch above the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour. (See video and photo above for a visual.)\",\"Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top doesn’t burn.)\",\"Bake the bread: Bake for 30-34 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you notice the top browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. (I usually add aluminum foil over the loaf around the 20 minute mark.) To test for doneness, if you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an instant-read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 195–200°F (90–93°C).\",\"Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes in the pan on a cooling rack before removing the bread from the pan and slicing. Feel free to let it cool completely before slicing, too.\",\"Cover leftover bread tightly and store at room temperature for 6 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.\"]",
